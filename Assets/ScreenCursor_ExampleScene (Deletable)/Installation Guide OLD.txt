Installation Guide:

1) Missing .dll files:
 There are supposed to be 2 .dll files in the Plugins folder , in case the .dll files are missing you can get them from
 ...Unity/Editor/Data/Mono/lib/mono/2.0/ in your computer and then copy the files named "System.Windows.Forms.dll"
, "System.Drawing.dll" and paste them inside the Plugins folder in your unity Project directory !!
These 2 .dll files are vital and the asset will not work without them !

1.1) If the files already exist:
Do not change the location of the System.Drawing or System.Windows.Forms files located inside the Plugins folder.

2) Api Compability Level:
Open Unity and go to Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings -> Api Compability Level and set it to ".NET 2.0"

3)Aplying Cursor Component
Drag the "ScreenCursor" C# script located inside of Plugins folder and drop it on any form of gameobject inside your scene.

3.1) Script Communication:
If you dont already know, if you change the location of "ScreenCursor" C# script you wont be able to call any of the API above from any UnityScript !
(Sometimes newest unity versions dont recognize the script so you may be limited on Csharp only unless you find another way around)

4) Compressed format:
If for any reason the asset doesnt work or there are more than the 2 .dll files missing try unzipping the .rar file
,extract the unity package and import the assets as you would normally.
